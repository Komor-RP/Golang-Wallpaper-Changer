# Golang WallPaper Changer (Windows)

## What Does This Do?

This app gets the top 25 posts from https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/hot/, picks a random post, downloads the image, and sets it as the desktop background on Windows.

## How To Use

Assuming you have Golang installed, you can clone this repo and run

```console
go run main.go
```

to compile and run the app, or

```console
go build main.go
```

to compile the app into an executable main.exe


## Future Development

I am planning on triangulating the backgrounds as well, making low poly versions of the downloaded wallpapers.
